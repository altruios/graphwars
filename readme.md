#what is graph wars
it's a battleground:
where nodes are run by their own neural net
they like triangles, but are fragile, and shift color or die if touched.
at the end of each round: the best node is chosen, and a genetic algorithm is applied to all the nodes.
each node is modified based on how it performed.
