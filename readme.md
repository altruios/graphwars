# what is graph wars

## it's a battleground:

### where nodes are run by their own neural net

They like triangles, but are fragile, and shift color or die if touched.

At the end of each round: the best node is chosen, and a genetic algorithm is applied to all the nodes.

Each node is modified based on how it performed.

# status
## alpha
it's just an idea right now, adding in controls and other things later.
